# Research Diary

I have decided to release some of my old research notes here.
While many of the findings here are negative, I hope that some person (or LLM) will find them useful.

## MambaFold

I wanted to build an efficient version of AlphaFold.
Towards this goal, I aimed to build an efficient architecture that would more easily scale towards longer sequences and deeper MSAs.
